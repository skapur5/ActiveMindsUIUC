                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Active Minds is the leading nonprofit organization that empowers students to speak openly about mental health in order to educate others and encourage help-seeking.  We are changing the culture on campuses and in the community by providing information, leadership opportunities and advocacy training to the next generation.
                        <br> <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp By developing and supporting chapters of a student-run mental health awareness, education, and advocacy group on campuses nationwide, the nonprofit organization works to increase studentsâ€™ awareness of mental health issues, provide information and resources regarding mental health and mental illness, encourage students to seek help as soon as it is needed, and serve as liaison between students and the mental health community.
                        <br> <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Through campus-wide events and national programs, Active Minds aims to remove the stigma that surrounds mental health issues, and create a comfortable environment for an open conversation about mental health issues on campuses nationwide.</p>

                                  <p>Hi! My name is Adrianna Jelen, and I am a senior studying Molecular and Cellular Biology, pre-med. I am originally from Poland and reside in a small western suburb of Chicago known as Franklin Park. Ronald Lewis introduced me to Active Minds last summer, and I fell in love with the organizations goals and message. I believe everyone is effected by mental health no matter who you are, and it is very prevalent on college campuses. Even if you directly do not posses a mental health diagnosis, someone you know is definitely going through mental health struggles. With this new UIUC chapter of Active Minds we will attempt our best efforts to fight the stigma and help create a safe and welcoming environment for those who need support. I hope you join us in this campaign!</p>

My vision definitely coincides with that of the team because we ultimately want to help break down the stigma and bring aid to those in need. Mental health is an incredibly prevalent issue on college campuses. For this reason I feel that spreading awareness is crucial. </p>
